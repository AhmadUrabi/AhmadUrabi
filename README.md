## Constantly Learning
I am constantly learning, as I realized the more I know the more I don't know. Technology is always evolving, and we need to try and keep up with it.
I am currently learning Nuxt and Vue, and working on improving my ASP.NET skills.
I am always interested in developing my DevOps skills, as they are essential for building production applications that conform to strict standards.
